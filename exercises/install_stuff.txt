* Exercise 3: install git

  Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/

  Mac or Linux: first check to see whether git is already installed by 
  opening a terminal and entering 

  git --version

  Then hit enter. It will print a version number if it's already installed.
  If not, download and install the appropriate version from here:
  
  https://git-scm.com/downloads


* Exercise 4: clone our course repository

  1. Open git bash (windows) or a terminal (mac or linux). 
  
  2. You should be in your home directory. Create a new directory
     inside your home directory by entering
   
     $ mkdir my6020directory
   
     You can store all your files for this course in here. If you are comfortable
     navigating your directories, feel free to put this directory
     wherever you want.

     By the way, don't type "$ ". Just type "mkdir my6020directory" and hit enter.
     "$ " is simply my notation to indicate
     that you are entering the following command in the terminal.
     
  3. Navigate to your new directory by entering
     
     $ cd my6020directory
     
     Your terminal prompt should change, indicating that you have changed directories.
     
  4. Clone the course repository by entering
     
     git clone https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/jsg342/btry6020_2021.git
     
     It may ask you to enter a username, e-mail, or password. Your username
     and password are the same as your cornell netid. You will now have a new
     folder (directory) called 'btry6020_2021' inside of 'my6020directory' 
     containing some course files. You can even see this directory in your finder.
